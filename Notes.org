* Problem Statement
** Word spell check - standalone words are given and you are supposed to suggest corrections.
** Phrase spell check - words present in a phrases need to be checked for spelling
** Sentence spell check - an entire sentence needs to be checked for spelling
* Input
** query1
** query2
** ...
* Output
** query{i} suggestion1 prob1 suggestion2 prob2 ...
** prob1 = P (suggestion1 | query{i})
* Metrics
** EP, ER, EF1
* Word spell-check
** Edit distance will suffice
** But to which distance will we consider alternative words?
* Phrase and sentence spell-check
** Context-sensitive spell-checking
* Evaluation
** We need C (q), the set of all suggestions we produced for q, and the corresponding posterior probabilities P (c | q)
** TODO S (q) - set of human-annotated plausible spelling variations for q
* Code - SpellChecker
** Training
*** Take in S (q) (?) or some training data
** generate_suggestions (q) -> [(suggestion, posterior), ...]
*** or C (q) and P (c | q)
** evaluate_suggestions (q, C (q), P (c | q), S (q)) -> [EP, ER]
** EF1 = HM (EP, ER)
** record_performance (EF1, Q)
