%Put here the basic sketch of the algorithm. It must contain the assumptions that you
%are making, if any, and the basic method of the algorithm.
\section{Algorithm Sketch}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Candidate word selection : Out of words within edit distance of two,
top K words are chosen based on weighted edit distance.
\item Candidate phrase generation : A simple cartesian product of all the
candidate words suggested for each word in the query make up the candidate
suggested phrase.
\item Prior for each candidate phrase : Microsoft N gram service results are
used as prior for each candidate phrase.
\item Likelihood for query given candidate : Assuming the probability
exponentially decreases as the number of edits required increases, likelihood
is calculated as $e^{-(weighted\ edit\ distance / length)}$
\end{enumerate}


%Put here the results on the sample cases provided. Both the expected average precision and
%recall. Also your observations on the results obtained.
\section{Results \& Observations}


%Put here the resources used along with the url if any of the resource used. If you want, you can attach a bibtex file along too.
