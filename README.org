		     README - Spell Check Project

* Spell Check Project for NLP course
* Instructions for running the code
** To test the Spell Checker on the data in the data/ folder
   ./src/test-script.py run-test
** To calculate statistics based on the last run
   ./src/test-script.py calc-stats
** To view statistics of all previous runs, see ./data/phrases.stats (or words.stats or sentences.stats as the case may be)
* Algorithm Sketch
** Candidate word selection
   Out of words within edit distance of two, top K words are chosen based on weighted edit distance.
** Candidate phrase generation
   A simple cartesian product of all the candidate words suggested for each word in the query make up the candidate suggested phrase.
** Prior for each candidate phrase
   Microsoft N gram service results are used as prior for each candidate phrase.
** Likelihood for query given candidate
   Assuming the probability exponentially decreases as the number of edits required increases, likelihood is calculated as e^{âˆ’(weighted edit distance/length)}
